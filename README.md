Run npm install in your project root to install all dependencies (including Vite).

After installation completes, try running your command again:
npm run dev

If you still get the error after running npm install, itâ€™s possible that vite is not listed as a dependency. In that case, you can add it by running:
npm install vite --save-dev

npm run build
